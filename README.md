# University Information Management System

This project was developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (NDAT)** course in our Computer Engineering curriculum. The main goal was to design and implement a basic **Information Management System** for a university using the principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To create a system that can manage university-related operations, including:

- Student information tracking
- Course management
- Instructor assignments
- Grade recording and reporting

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET (Windows Forms)
- **Database**: Local data storage / file-based handling (if applicable)

## 💡 Key Features

- Object-oriented architecture with encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Basic user interface for data entry and interaction
- Modular design to ensure scalability and easy maintenance

## 📁 Project Structure

- `MainForm.cs`: UI and main logic controller
- `Student.cs`, `Course.cs`, `Instructor.cs`: Core class models
- `Program.cs`: Entry point of the application

## 🧪 Usage

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Build the solution.
3. Run the application via the main form.
4. Use the UI to add/manage students, courses, and instructors.

## 🎓 About the Course

This project was developed during the **4th year** of our undergraduate studies in the **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design** course. It helped reinforce core software engineering principles, including class design, system modeling, and architectural thinking.
